## L1L2samplesT142

This folder contains samples from lanes 1 AND 2 of RAD sequencing which were demultiplexed, filtered, trimmed and renamed by `process_radtags` STACKS V1.44.

*File description*

gzipped fastq files: `.fq.gz` 

Lane 1: forward and reverse sequence files (PE 150)

Lane 2: forward sequence files only (SR 150)

These samples were used to run the combined [Lanes 1 and 2 stacks pipeline](https://github.com/mfisher5/mf-fish546-PCod/blob/master/notebooks/Lanes%201%20and%202%20combined%20pipeline.ipynb), which ultimately yielded final [Population structure analyses](https://github.com/mfisher5/mf-fish546-PCod/blob/master/notebooks/Lanes%201%20and%202%20combined%2C%20Analyses%20%2B%20Results.ipynb)
