## L2samplesT110/

Samples from lane 2 of RAD sequencing, demultiplexed, filtered, trimmed and renamed by `process_radtags` STACKS v1.44

The samples in this folder were primarily used to determine if trimming to smaller sequence size increases the number of sequences retained in samples with fully degraded DNA. It did not, so they were not used for further analyses.
