## L2samplesT110/

*These samples have been cleaned and trimmed by stacks::process_radtags*

*Description:* Raw sequencing data has been separated by barcode and renamed to the appropriate sample. Trimmed to 110 base pairs. 

This folder is primarily to determine if trimming to smaller sequence size increases the number of sequences retained in samples with fully degraded DNA.
