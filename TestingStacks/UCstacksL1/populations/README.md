## Populations: stacks module ##

**This folder contains:** 

(1) output files from running `populations`

(2) text files that I created, using the `populations` *genepop* and *.sumstats* output files. The two text file types are "Het", which contain per SNP heterozygosity extracted from the *sumstats* file, and "Loci", which contain a list of loci and their associated SNPs that were extracted from the *genepop* file. 

(3) an [R script](https://github.com/mfisher5/mf-fish546-2016/blob/master/UCstacksL1/populations/CalculateHeterozygosity.R) for working with and visualizing the heterozygosity data. 

(4) a [python script](https://github.com/mfisher5/mf-fish546-2016/blob/master/UCstacksL1/populations/LocusCount.py) for counting the number of loci in the "Loci" files I created 

(5) the stderr files for each run of `populations`.
