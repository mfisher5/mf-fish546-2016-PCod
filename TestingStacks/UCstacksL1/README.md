## UCstacksL1 ##

This folder is for testing parameters in u- and cstacks using the lane 1 data (subset, not including Yellow Sea samples, so n = 57). It contains:

(1) data from stacks runs for each parameter change (not limited to u- and cstacks output)

(2) shell scripts that were used to run stacks

(3) stacks reporting output (stderr) saved into text files.
