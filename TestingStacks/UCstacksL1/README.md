## UCstacksL1 ##

**Description:** This folder is for testing parameters in u- and cstacks using the lane 1 data (subset, not including Yellow Sea samples, so n = 57). It contains:

(1) data from stacks runs for each parameter change (not limited to u- and cstacks output)

(2) shell scripts that were used to run stacks

(3) stacks reporting output (stderr) saved into text files. 

*Some shell scripts have been placed in this directory and not in the `scripts/` folder because I was having trouble running stacks using a non-relative path with more than one directory to navigate through. So for the current code that I am running, I keep the script in this folder. If I no longer need that shell script, it will be moved to the `scripts/` folder. The python code for generating the shell scripts can be found in the `scripts/` folder.*
