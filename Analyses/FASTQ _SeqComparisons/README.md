## Analyses/FASTQ_SeqComparisons

This folder contains text files, R code, and excel spreadsheets that compare the sequence counts in the lane 2 data. These analyses were completed because I need to compare the relative effectiveness of my new protocols for 300ng (low) DNA, and for fully degraded DNA. 

Graphs can be found in the `Lane2_radtags_seqCounts.xlsx` file.
